# Violence Detection Using 3D ConvNet
Cancer presents humans with an ongoing challenge in medical diagnosis and treatment. Histopathological analysis, the examination of tissue samples under a microscope, is a critical tool in detecting and diagnosing cancers, including lung and colon cancer. This repository aims to leverage advanced deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of histopathological image analysis.

# Project Overview
- **Dataset**: Utilized Real Life Violence Situations Dataset consisting of 2000 Videos
- **Model Architectures**: Utilized and fine-tuned efficient_x3d_s
- **Results**: Achieved average validation accuracy of 1.0 and loss of 0.015
- **Pipeline**: Designed a pipeline for future inference of videos
